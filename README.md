Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Internship repository!  
This repository contains projects that I worked on during my internship in the field of Artificial Intelligence.


Throughout the internship, I worked on several projects and tasks, such as:
- Predictive modeling using regression and classification
- Image recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing with transformers and LSTM
- Model optimization and hyperparameter tuning
